I’m IT engineer specialized in web development. I have more than 10 years experience in web projects as full stack developer.

Interested in Agile Software Development Methodologies, TDD and BDD, Design patterns and refactoring techniques. For the last year I was focused in Domain Driven Design and software architecture.

I´m specialized in PHP and the most important frameworks like Drupal 8 , Symfony2 and Laravel. I´m very interested in languages like Python and Ruby too. 

I have a pro-active role in PHPValencia community. My last session was “Decoupling Business Logic from the framework and hexagonal architecture” in DrupalCamp 2015.

Nowadays, I´m working on Prosodie Capgemini  as a Project Manager in several projects for Movistar.
